### Greetings.

I'm Ana√Øs. Friends call me Ania. I'm working as a penetration tester. 
I get bored easily so I'm always learning something new. I'm a translation & geopolitics graduate who decided to eventually bruteforce her way in cybersecurity. Reading about data privacy brought me here. I hate the fact that big corporations make money over my data. I'm interested in OSINT, web exploitation, art, plants, sports and learning languages.

Here's my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anais-dhnd).
